    It took 5 women 2 getcha off of my mind
    It took 5 months, a plenty good wasted time
    But it just took 5 minutes when I saw your face again
    2 fall in love all over, I guess with U I'll never win

    March was a cold one in more ways than one
    Went down 2 the nightclub lookin' 4 the sun
    Lookin' 4 a light that could brighten up a day
    That's been darker than a hole since U went away

    April usually brings showers
    This time it was a hurtin' kind
    This woman said she wanted my baby
    I told her I'd have 2 be deaf, dumb, and blind
    2 fall in love with someone that I barely knew
    The baby would never really have a father
    Cuz I still, cuz I still, cuz I still, still, still, huh
    Be stuck on U

    It took 5 women 2 getcha off of my mind
    Get off my mind, baby
    Fallin' in love all over... U I'll never win

    May was her name, she was jumpin'
    Jumpin' from plane 2 plane
    Actress or model or somethin'
    Can't even remember her first name

    June brought an Easter bunny
    Needless 2 say, hmph, that girl was late
    Told a made-up story 2 a busy-body of our only date
    What a sketch!

    July was a heartbreak, extraordinary
    Said I met this woman whose kiss was somethin' scary
    It felt so much, so much like yours
    But it only made me, made me want U more
    She's gone, she's gone but U're still here
    I want U very..., huh, it's U I fear

    But it took 5 women 2 get U off my mind
    It took 5 months, 5 months, a plenty good wasted time
    But it just took 5 minutes and I saw your face again
    I fell in love all over with U, I guess I'll never win

    35 MPH Town

    Mama locked the door last night for the first time in all of her years
    I said mama you gotta be kidding me, she said things ain't like they used to be round here
    You just wouldn't believe it, kids growing up without Jesus, good thing your daddy ain't here to see this now
    They stay higher than the water tower in this 35 MPH Town

    She said it ain't the drugs, it ain't the booze, I've had a backroad buzz or two, myself
    It seems like heaven is slipping further away, the devil ain't got far to go when they raise hell
    We used to burn a hole through midnight, smoking a stolen Marlboro Light and
    on a good night might kill a 5th of Crown But now there's a lower higher power in this 35 MPH town

    Oh we can't blame the babies for growing up lazy
    And crazy it ain't them that let them down
    If they ain't stealing, they're suing, why work when we'll give it to 'em
    It's right there in the bible that we don't put out
    Spare the rod and you'll sour a 35 MPH town

    The \"yes mam\"\'s gone and the \"please\"\'s too
    It's out the door with the \"thank you\" in the evening
    You don't see a front yard football game
    The neighbor kids have done away with the shirt and skins
    No one hits the front porch lights to get the kids to come inside
    Cause the streets ain't safe for a bike to ride down
    Since they planted a prowler in this 35 MPH town
    No they're going nowhere fast tonight no matter how fast they drive this 35 Hour Town
