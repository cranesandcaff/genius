  ill_make_a_man_out_of_you:
  """Let's get down to business, to defeat the Huns
Did they send me daughters, when I asked for sons?
You're the saddest bunch I ever met
But you can bet, before we're through
Mister, I'll make a man out of you

Tranquil as a forest, but on fire within
Once you find your center, you are sure to win
You're a spineless, pale pathetic lot
And you haven't got a clue
Somehow I'll make a man out of you

I'm never gonna catch my breath
Say good-bye to those who knew me
Boy, was I a fool in school for cutting gym
This guy's got 'em scared to death
Hope he doesn't see right through me
Now I really wish that I knew how to swim

[Chorus]
Be a man
We must be swift as a coursing river
Be a man
With all the force of a great typhoon
Be a man
With all the strength of a raging fire
Mysterious as the dark side of the moon

Time is racing toward us, till the Huns arrive
Heed my every order, and you might survive
You're unsuited for the rage of war
So pack up, go home, you're through
How could I make a man out of you?

[Chorus x2]""",

For Something Out There
Out Of Reach

  """No one to talk with
All by myself
No one to walk with
But I'm happy on the shelf
Ain't misbehavin'
I'm savin' my love for you

I know for certain
The one I love
I'm through with flirtin'
It's just you I'm thinkin' of
Ain't misbehavin'
I'm savin' my love for you
Like Jack Horner
In the corner
Don't go nowhere
What do I care?
Your kisses are worth waitin' for
Believe me

I don't stay out late
Don't care to go
I'm home about eight
Just me and my radio
Ain't misbehavin'
I'm savin' my love for you""",

  """[Verse 1]
What day is it? And in what month?
This clock never seemed so alive
I can't keep up and I can't back down
I've been losing so much time

[Hook]
Cause it's you and me and all of the people with nothing to do
Nothing to lose
And it's you and me and all other people
And I don't know why, I can't keep my eyes off of you
[Verse 2]
One of the things that I want to say just aren't coming out right
I'm tripping on words
You've got my head spinning
I don't know where to go from here

[Hook]
Cause it's you and me and all of the people with nothing to do
Nothing to prove
And it's you and me and all other people
And I don't know why, I can't keep my eyes off of you

[Bridge]
There's something about you now
I can't quite figure out
Everything she does is beautiful
Everything she does is right

[Hook]
Cause it's you and me and all of the people with nothing to do
Nothing to lose
And it's you and me and all other people
And I don't know why, I can't keep my eyes off of you
And me and all other people with nothing to do
Nothing to prove
And it's you and me and all other people
And I don't know why, I can't keep my eyes off of you

What day is it?
And in what month?
This clock never seemed so alive""",

  """[Bells/Guitar Intro]

[Verse 1]
I'm rolling thunder pouring rain
I'm coming on like a hurricane
White lightning flashing across the sky
You're only young but you're going to die
I won't take no prisoners won't spare no lives
Nobody's putting up a fight
I got my bell I'm going to take you to hell
I'm going to get you satan get you
[Chorus]
Hells bells, hells bells
Hells bells, you got me ringing
Hells bells, my temperature's high
Hells bells

[Verse 2]
I'll give you black sensations up and down your spine
If you're into evil, you're a friend of mine
See the white light flashing as I split the night
Because if good's on the left then I'm sticking to the right
I won't take no prisoners, won't spare no lives
Nobody's putting up a fight
I got my bell I'm going to take you to hell
I'm going to get you satan get you

[Chorus]
Hells bells, hells bells
Hells bells, you got me ringing
Hells bells, my temperature's high
Hells bells

[Guitar Solo]

Hells bells, satan coming to you
Hells bells, he's ringing them now

[Outro]
Those hells bells, my temperature's high
Hells bells, across the sky
Hells bells, they're taking you down
Hells bells, they're dragging you down
Hells bells, going to split the night
Hells bells, there's no way to fight""",

  """[Verse 1]
In the town where I was born
Lived a man who sailed to sea
And he told us of his life
In the land of submarines

[Verse 2]
So we sailed up to the sun
Till we found the sea of green
And we lived beneath the waves
In our yellow submarine
[Chorus]
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

[Verse 3]
And our friends are all on board
Many more of them live next door
And the band begins to play

[Chorus]
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

[Verse 4]
Full speed ahead, Mr. Parker, full speed ahead
Full speed over here, sir
Action station, action station
Aye, aye, sir, fire
Heaven, heaven

[Verse 5]
As we live a life of ease
Everyone of us has all we need (has all we need)
Sky of blue (sky of blue) and sea of green (and sea of green)
In our (In our) yellow submarine (yellow submarine, ha-ha!)

We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine

We all live in a yellow submarine

And when you're lost I know how to change your mood
And when I'm down you breathe life over me

On a clear day
I'll fly home to you

  escape_pina_colada:
    """I was tired of my lady, we\'d been together too long
    Like a worn out recording of a favorite song
    So while she lay there sleepin\' I read the paper in bed
    And in the personal columns, there was this letter I read

    If you like piña coladas and getting caught in the rain
    If you\'re not into yoga, if you have half a brain
    If you like making love at midnight in the dunes of the cape
    Then I\'m the love that you\'ve looked for, write to me and escape

    I didn\'t think about my lady, I know that sounds kind of mean
    But me and my old lady had fallen into the same old dull routine
    So I wrote to the paper, took out a personal ad
    And though I\'m nobody\'s poet, I thought it wasn\'t half bad

    Yes, I like piña coladas and getting caught in the rain
    I\'m not much into health food, I am into champagne
    I\'ve got to meet you by tomorrow noon and cut through all this red tape
    At a bar called O\'Malley\'s where we\'ll plan our escape

    So I waited with high hopes and she walked in the place
    I knew her smile in an instant, I knew the curve of her face
    It was my own lovely lady and she said, \"oh, it\'s you.\"
    Then we laughed for a moment and I said, \"I never knew.\"

    That you like piña coladas and gettin\' caught in the rain
    And the feel of the ocean and the taste of champagne
    If you like making love at midnight in the dunes on the cape
    You\'re the lady I\'ve looked for, come with me and escape

    If you like piña coladas and getting caught in the rain
    If you\'re not into yoga, if you have half a brain
    If you like making love at midnight in the dunes on the cape
    Then I\'m the love that you\'ve looked for, write to me and escape

    Yes I like piña coladas and getting caught in the rain
    I\'m not much into health food, I am into champagne
    I\'ve got to meet you by tomorrow noon and cut through all this red tape
